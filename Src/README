Tests folder explanation

In test folder can be found unit/module tests. In order to test some specific functionality,
exclude main.c file from build and include test file. For e.g. include 001_Printf.c. All other
files in Tests folder should be excluded, only one should be included. It's possible to change
test files to your needs. All tests files by default will be excluded from build.
